# MongoDB-Training
Educational scripts to set up a Standalone, a Replica Set or a Sharded environment.

To start a MongoDB cluster, just start the scripts in the order one by one.
Update them to match your architecture.

For this example, all the scripts are deploying nodes on 127.0.0.1...

NB : The script #9 inserts datas with a monotonic key which is NOT a good idea... This is for educational purpose.
